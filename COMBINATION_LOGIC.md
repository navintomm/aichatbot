# 🧠 Symptom Combination Logic - How It Works

## Dynamic Intersection Logic

Your AI Healthcare Assistant uses **Dynamic Intersection Logic** to analyze symptom combinations and provide increasingly accurate diagnoses as more symptoms are added.

## The Mathematical Model

For each disease `I`, the system calculates a **Matching Percentage** `P(I)`:

```
P(I) = (Weighted Match Score / Total Disease Weight) × Match Ratio × Severity Factor × 100
```

Where:
- **Weighted Match Score**: Sum of weights for matched symptoms
- **Total Disease Weight**: Sum of all symptom weights for that disease
- **Match Ratio**: Percentage of user symptoms that matched (0.7-1.0 multiplier)
- **Severity Factor**: Correlation between user severity and disease severity (0.9-1.1 multiplier)

## Real-World Examples

### Case 1: Single Symptom - "Cough"

**User Input:**
- Symptoms: `[Cough]`
- Duration: 1-3 Days
- Severity: 4

**System Processing:**
```javascript
Analyzing against 25 diseases...
- Common Cold: Cough weight = 0.8 → Confidence: 45%
- Bronchitis: Cough weight = 0.95 → Confidence: 52%
- Influenza: Cough weight = 0.8 → Confidence: 38%
- Asthma: Cough weight = 0.8 → Confidence: 41%
- COVID-19: Cough weight = 0.9 → Confidence: 43%
```

**Result:** Broad possibilities, multiple respiratory conditions

---

### Case 2: Two Symptoms - "Cough + Fever"

**User Input:**
- Symptoms: `[Cough, Fever]`
- Duration: 1-3 Days
- Severity: 7

**System Processing:**
```javascript
Analyzing against 25 diseases...
- Common Cold: 
  - Cough (0.8) + Fever (0.0) = 0.8/1.6 → Confidence: 35% ⬇️
- Influenza: 
  - Cough (0.8) + Fever (0.95) = 1.75/2.5 → Confidence: 78% ⬆️
- Bronchitis: 
  - Cough (0.95) + Fever (0.5) = 1.45/2.2 → Confidence: 58%
- COVID-19: 
  - Cough (0.9) + Fever (0.85) = 1.75/2.4 → Confidence: 75% ⬆️
```

**Result:** Narrows to viral infections (Flu, COVID-19)
**Logic:** Allergies and simple colds filtered out due to high fever

---

### Case 3: Three Symptoms - "Cough + Fever + Shortness of Breath"

**User Input:**
- Symptoms: `[Cough, Fever, Shortness of breath]`
- Duration: 4-7 Days
- Severity: 8

**System Processing:**
```javascript
Analyzing against 25 diseases...
- Influenza: 
  - Cough (0.8) + Fever (0.95) + SOB (0.0) = 1.75/2.5 → Confidence: 62% ⬇️
- COVID-19: 
  - Cough (0.9) + Fever (0.85) + SOB (0.7) = 2.45/3.1 → Confidence: 82% ⬆️
- Pneumonia: 
  - Cough (0.9) + Fever (0.85) + SOB (0.85) = 2.6/3.2 → Confidence: 87% ⬆️⬆️
- Asthma Attack: 
  - Cough (0.8) + Fever (0.0) + SOB (0.95) = 1.75/2.3 → Confidence: 65%
```

**Result:** 🚨 **HIGH-RISK ALERT** - Pneumonia flagged as top match
**Logic:** The cluster of respiratory symptoms + fever + breathing difficulty triggers severe respiratory infection alert

---

### Case 4: Complex Cluster - "Headache + Blurred Vision + Thirst + Fatigue"

**User Input:**
- Symptoms: `[Headache, Blurred vision, Thirst, Fatigue]`
- Duration: 1 Week +
- Severity: 6

**System Processing:**
```javascript
Initial Analysis:
- Migraine: Headache (1.0) + Blurred Vision (0.6) = 1.6/2.3 → 58%
- Tension Headache: Headache (0.95) + others (0.0) = 0.95/1.5 → 42%

Adding "Thirst":
- Diabetes: Headache (0.6) + Blurred Vision (0.75) + Thirst (0.9) + Fatigue (0.85) = 3.1/3.8 → 85% ⬆️⬆️
- Dehydration: Headache (0.7) + Blurred Vision (0.0) + Thirst (0.95) + Fatigue (0.85) = 2.5/3.2 → 72%
```

**Result:** 🔄 **CATEGORY SHIFT** - From neurological to metabolic/endocrine
**Logic:** The addition of "Thirst" completely changes the diagnostic direction

## The "X" Button Critical Logic

### Scenario: Accidental Selection

**User accidentally clicks "Chest Pain" instead of "Abdominal Pain":**

```javascript
// Before removal:
Active Chips: [Nausea, Chest Pain, Dizziness]
Top Match: Anxiety Disorder (68%), Hypertension Crisis (62%)
Category: Cardiovascular/Mental Health

// User clicks "X" on "Chest Pain":
Active Chips: [Nausea, Dizziness]
Top Match: Vertigo (72%), Migraine (58%)
Category: Neurological ✅ CORRECTED

// User adds correct symptom "Abdominal Pain":
Active Chips: [Nausea, Dizziness, Abdominal Pain]
Top Match: Gastroenteritis (81%), Food Poisoning (75%)
Category: Gastrointestinal ✅ ACCURATE
```

**This prevents "Logic Drift"** - the system only analyzes verified symptoms!

## Combination Detection Features

### 1. **Category Grouping**
When multiple diseases in the same category score high:
```javascript
Result: "Multiple Respiratory Conditions Possible"
- Bronchitis: 72%
- Pneumonia: 68%
- COVID-19: 65%
```

### 2. **Co-occurring Conditions**
When diseases from different categories both score high:
```javascript
Result: "Influenza with possible Dehydration"
- Primary: Influenza (78%)
- Secondary: Dehydration (62%)
- Combined Confidence: 70%
```

### 3. **Severity-Based Alerts**
```javascript
if (severity >= 8 && topMatch.severity === "severe") {
  Alert: "🚨 SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION"
}
```
